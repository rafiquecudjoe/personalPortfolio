Designing a secure payment API involves much more than exposing endpoints that accept card data or mobile money references.

## Core Principles

1. Never store raw sensitive data.
2. Enforce idempotency for payment initiation.
3. Use message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ) for asynchronous settlement & notification workflows.
4. Sign all outbound webhook payloads.
5. Apply strict rate limiting & anomaly detection.

## Layered Architecture

```
Client -> Edge (WAF/CDN) -> API Gateway -> Auth Layer -> Payment Orchestrator -> Providers / Ledger
```

- API Gateway: centralizes auth, throttling, metrics.
- Orchestrator: handles routing logic for multiple payment channels (cards, mobile money, ACH, crypto).
- Ledger: append-only record of financial events (create internal consistency boundary).

## NestJS Module Structure

```
/payment
  /dto
  /controllers
  /services
  /strategies
  /integrations
  /events
```

## Security Highlights

- Encrypt PAN or external reference tokens (never raw values) using envelope encryption (KMS + data keys).
- HMAC sign all provider callbacks.
- Use short-lived JWT or mTLS for internal service-to-service calls.
- Separate read models (reporting) from write models (command/payment state machine).

## Idempotency Keys

Store a hash of (client_id + external_reference) with status. Reject duplicates while pending/processed.

## Observability

Track: latency per provider, success rate, reversal rate, fraud signals, queue lag, ledger drift.

## Next Steps

In future posts: ledger design, reconciliation pipelines, fraud modeling, and real-time notification channels.
