Building a trading platform blends distributed systems, performance tuning, and strict correctness in state transitions.

## Core Components

- Market Data Ingestion (provider streams -> normalizer)
- Order API (REST + WebSocket upgrade)
- Matching / Routing Engine
- Event Bus (RabbitMQ) for fills, cancels, ledger postings
- Portfolio / Positions Service
- Notification / Webhook Service

## Real-time Data Flow

```
Providers -> Normalizer -> Broadcast Hub -> WebSocket Fan-out -> Clients
```

Cache hot symbols & order book snapshots in Redis. Stream incremental updates (diffs) to clients.

## Performance Techniques

- Backpressure handling at WebSocket layer
- Coalesce bursts into micro-batches
- Use ring buffers for matching operations
- Preallocate objects to reduce GC churn (Node.js tuning)

## Consistency & Integrity

- Sequence IDs for book updates
- Idempotent order acknowledgements
- Atomic portfolio adjustments

## Latency Targets (illustrative)

- Sub 50ms order acknowledgement
- < 150ms fill confirmation
- < 250ms portfolio update broadcast

## Testing Strategies

- Replay historical streams for regression
- Chaos inject (provider stalls, partial outages)
- Latency budget dashboards per hop

## Final Note

Future deep dives: risk engine design, advanced matching strategies, and ledger reconciliation.
