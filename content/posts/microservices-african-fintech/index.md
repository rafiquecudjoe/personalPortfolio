African fintech presents unique architectural constraints: intermittent connectivity, heterogeneous payment rails (mobile money, bank transfers, agency networks), and regulatory fragmentation.

## Key Challenges

- Multi-rail transaction orchestration
- Currency + FX handling
- Eventual consistency in liquidity & ledger states
- Regional compliance (mobile KYC flows, sanctions, data residency)

## Service Taxonomy Example

```
Auth Service
KYC & Compliance Service
Payment Orchestrator
Wallet / Accounts Service
Ledger Service
Notification Service
FX / Rates Service
Settlement Service
Reporting & Analytics
Fraud & Risk Engine
```

## Communication Patterns

- Synchronous: GraphQL/REST for low-latency queries (balance, status)
- Asynchronous: RabbitMQ / Kafka for payment lifecycle events
- Outbox Pattern for reliable event publishing

## Data Strategy

- Polyglot persistence (PostgreSQL for ledger, Redis for ephemeral balances, S3/object store for audit artifacts)
- Use versioned schema evolution & protobuf/Avro for events

## Resilience

- Circuit breakers per provider
- Idempotent consumers & saga-based compensation flows
- Dead-letter queues with auto reprocessing window

## Latency Tactics

- Regional edge tokenization
- Co-locate critical services near payment gateway POPs
- Batch reconciliation off-peak

## Metrics That Matter

- Authorization success rate
- Average provider round-trip
- Reversal ratio
- Ledger vs provider drift
- Queue depth & consumer lag

## Closing Thoughts

A disciplined microservice architecture enables modular scaling, faster compliance adaptation, and resilience in fragmented financial ecosystems.
